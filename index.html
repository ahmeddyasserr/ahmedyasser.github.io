                <p><strong>   there! My name is Ahmed, and I am excited to introduce myself in this portfolio. I am an 18-year-old first-year student in Computer Science at Zewail University for Science and Technology. I have a wide range of interests, including volunteering, working in teams, traveling, and finding scholarships. However, my passion lies in the field of technology, and I am particularly interested in cloud computing.

                    I strongly believe that volunteering and working in teams can make a positive impact on our community and help us achieve our goals. I am always looking for ways to use my skills and abilities to help others, and I am committed to making a difference in the world.
                    
                    In addition to my love of volunteering, I also enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures. I believe that traveling helps broaden our perspective and allows us to see the world from different angles. Furthermore, I am eager to learn about different technologies, and I am always staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field, especially in cloud computing.
                    
                    I am thrilled to be pursuing my passion in Computer Science at Zewail University for Science and Technology, and I am excited to see what the future holds. Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction, and I hope you enjoy the rest of my portfolio. </strong></p>

            As a volunteer at the Cairo Book Fair, I had the opportunity to be a part of one of the most important events in the world of literature. This year's event was particularly significant as it was the first edition after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was crucial for us to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our visitors.
            
            During my time as a volunteer, I played an important role in guiding and assisting visitors at the fair. Whether it was helping them navigate the different sections of the event, recommending books or providing information about specific authors, I was always on hand to offer my support.
            
            In addition to my duties as a guide, I also helped to ensure that all necessary safety protocols were being followed. This included monitoring the number of people in different areas, reminding visitors to wear masks and sanitize their hands regularly, and ensuring that social distancing measures were being maintained.
            
            Overall, my experience as a volunteer at the Cairo Book Fair was incredibly fulfilling. Not only did I get to be a part of an important literary event, but I also had the chance to contribute to the safety and wellbeing of our visitors. I am proud to have been a part of this important endeavor and look forward to continuing my work as a volunteer in the future</p>

          </strong>
          <p class="project-subtitle">As a volunteer at the BYF (Build Your Future) event organized by OBM Education, I had the privilege of helping high school students in their journey towards choosing their college and career path. The event aimed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of different academic disciplines and career options available to them, and to help them make informed decisions about their future.

            During my time as a volunteer, I assisted students by providing them with relevant information about different colleges, programs, and career paths. I also answered their queries, clarified their doubts, and provided guidance on the various aspects of college and career planning. It was truly a rewarding experience to help students gain a better understanding of their options and help them make decisions that could potentially shape their entire future.
            
            The event was organized meticulously, and students were provided with a range of resources and information to help them make informed decisions. From interactive workshops and panel discussions to one-on-one guidance sessions, the event provided students with a variety of opportunities to learn, explore and make decisions about their future.
            
            As a volunteer, I found the experience of guiding and helping students extremely fulfilling. The BYF event played an important role in preparing and empowering the next generation of leaders and professionals, and I was proud to be a part of this endeavor. I look forward to continuing my work as a volunteer and helping students make informed decisions about their future.F</p>
